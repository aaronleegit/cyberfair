            <p> This project has made me understand the importance of teamwork. It was only after multiple brainstorming
                sessions with our teacher before our team decided on the topic for this project. After further work
                delegation, everyone gave their best effort to complete all the paperwork within a limited time. Such a
                large-scale task cannot be done by one person alone. Coding for a web page proved to be quite a
                challenge
                even after multiple classes I took. As a result, I understood that theory must work with actual
                implementation. I realized that practice makes perfect. This was a very interesting research topic. I
                derived a lot of benefit from the competition process. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to
                all
                of my teachers for their guidance, and my heartfelt appreciation to my teammates for displaying the
                highest
                level of teamwork.

            <p>During the times of working on this assignment, I have learned plenty and increased my knowledge about
                our
                cultures. Before I indulged in this topic, I have always thought that artifacts were displayed and never
                touched again, though in careful preservation conditions. But after actually interviewing a restorer and
                researching about the restoration of artifacts,I realize that before displaying the artifacts, there are
                tons of careful and delicate procedures being performed. Not only did I learn about our cultures, I also
                mastered the ability to work on digital art and coding actual websites. This assignment allowed me to
                master
                and gain knowledge about two different topics, and would thus be an unforgettable experience.

            <p>Before when I heard about restoration, I thought it meant simply turning an artwork back to its original
                form. But after the interviews, I found out that “reversibility” is actually the main goal of the whole
                restoration process. Dr. Hong told us that, " When we are restoring artworks, we usually hope that we
                only
                do what is necessary so that we wouldn’t leave any burden to other restorers." I’ve really learned a lot
                through the whole project-making process.

            <p>This is my first time participating in CyberFair. We collected information, interviewed, took pictures,
                recorded, searched information, and made web pages. After a lot of discussions and effort, our effort
                finally paid off. In every interview, everyone was prepared in order to present it completely. The
                restorer’s dedication to the cultural relics impressed me a lot, and I learned a lot about the
                importance of
                the restorer’s preservation of cultural relics. From this project, I learned a lot of new knowledge, and
                the
                most important thing, teamwork. We are a team, and everyone needs to participate and contribute to the
                project.

            <p> We started this project and prepared for this competition since this July. Over the past six months,
                I’ve
                benefited a great deal from it. Not until now did I know that every piece and collection in the museum
                has
                to go through a very high and strict checkup before they are displayed in the exhibition. We also
                learned
                how to write our own webpage with programming HTML. In order to analyze the survey that we received from
                more than 400 people, I also studied Excel. I’m very thankful to the participation of this competition,
                it
                made me more knowledgeable and skillful in many different aspects. Through this project, we hope to
                raise
                public awareness toward restorers because they do play such an important role in inheriting culture.

            <p>This is my first time participating in CyberFair, and my IT skills have improved. From the most basic
                skill
                searching things on the internet to programming, I learn quickly. In the beginning, I was passively
                cooperating with the teachers and team members, but later I became proactive and tried my best to make
                contributions to the group. Now, I am an editor, editing interview videos for our group; adding lively
                video
                content to the website. I think teamwork makes the result more meaningful.
