        <p>A restorer must have the full knowledge of the materials which are used in those
            artifacts and understand different painting techniques.</p>
        <p> In the past, a restorer must be an apprentice for three years and four months to learn the required skills
            and knowledge. Now restoration becomes a major in school. There are many courses a student has to take in
            order to become a restorer, like chemistry, and materials courses. </p>

        <h2>1. Responsibility, Education, and Requirement of Restorers</h2>
		<img class="r-img w-2" src="../assets/img/restorer/170.jpg" />
        <p>An excellent art restorer is responsible for repairing cultural reliefs such as murals, sculptures, ceramics,
            textiles, paintings, calligraphies, books, and other cultural objects or historical artifacts. The job often
            requires research to know what the best course of action to take. Below, an art restorer's duties,
            education, training, certification, competencies, and skills will be mentioned. </p>
        <!-- HEAD: H3 -->
        <h3>(1) Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Cleaning an artwork and preserving it for the future are the main focus. However, there are still other tasks
            that might be involved, like developing and maintaining standards for storing, handling, installing,
            packing, shipping artworks, and collaborating with scientists or colleagues.</p>
        <!-- HEAD: H3 -->
        <h3>(2) Education</h3>
        <p>In the early days, restoration work resembled an apprenticeship. Like masters and apprentices, new staff work
            under the guidance of masters, and masters taught apprentices when the apprentices had any questions. </p>
        <p>Nowadays, a bachelor's degree in art conservation or a similar subject area is required. They might also need
            to learn chemistry, anthropology, studio art, and art history. And an art restorer still might want to
            apprentice under a master restorer before jumping into a major restoration project. </p>
        <p> Besides, "self-development" is also very important Restorers are often reminded that the artifacts are our
            best teachers. The artifacts contain a lot of information when been observed carefully. The restorers must
            have sufficient understanding of the artifacts so that they can come up with many usable materials and
            solutions.</p>
        <!-- HEAD: H3 -->
        <h3>(3) Requirements</h3>
        <p>1. A passion for the art.
            <br> 2. Detail-oriented and patience.
            <br> 3. Other essential skills depend on the project. For example, the knowledge of chemistry and in-depth
            understanding of paints and canvas.
        </p>


        <!-- HEAD: H2 -->
        <h2>2. Passing Down Knowledge</h2>
        <p>In the National Palace Museum, the restorers are all considered government employees who must pass an
            official examination before they can be recruited. Occasionally, when a senior restorer retired without
            hiring new employees, the working knowledge ran into the problem of not being passed down.</p>
