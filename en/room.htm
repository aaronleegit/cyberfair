        <h2>About National Taiwan Museum</h2>
        <p>The oldest museum in Taiwan was actually built when the Japanese were ruling Taiwan (1899). They wanted a
            museum built to show the humanities,geography, biology ......etc. of Taiwan. Therefore, through research and
            data, they presented the beauty of Taiwan through this museum.
        </p>
        <p>Before the Japanese came, Taiwan was not influenced by Western culture. After ruling by the Japanese, the
            Baroque style was introduced. As a result, most of the buildings built during that period were all in
            Baroque style.
        </p>
        <p>Our collections have been collected by the Japanese since then, and have continued until after the war. Most
            of our works in the department are about anthropology, but we still have some other collections.
        </p>
        <p>There are still some exhibits on zoology, geology, botany, and more. But today let’s focus on the
            anthropology part. If you are interested in other subjects, you can contact other departments for more
            details.
        </p>
        <h2>The Three Most Important Artifacts</h2>
        <p>Our most famous work is the Blue Flag with Yellow Tiger. We had it conserved a few years ago and then
            displayed it. It witnessed the establishment of democracy in Taiwan.
        </p>
        <p>The Portrait of Koxinga is another one used in textbooks and even potato chip packages.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, there is the The Origin of the Place Names in the Kang-Hsi Taiwan Map. It is the earliest map
            depicting the appearance of Taiwan.
        </p>
        <p>And these three pieces are the national treasures of our museum.
        </p>
        <p>A few years ago, we did a series of historical research investigations and scientific analysis, and then
            conservation. In fact, conservation is only one of the many steps in the study of artifacts. Our main goal
            is to improve the conditions of our artifact. If it is a more important product, we will have an experienced
            team do the conservation work.
        </p>
        <p>The other works are done in our conservation department. We are quite different from the one in the Palace
            Museum. In the National Palace Museum, they are full-time restorers, like Mr. Hong. They mainly concentrate
            on doing repairs every day, like a surgeon performing operations. Actions can be performed by specialized
            individuals. But our department, unlike theirs, cannot achieve that level of specialization. In our museum,
            conservators like me must know how to conserve all sorts of artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, when encountering more difficult and severely damaged artifacts, we will entrust other more
            professional teams to repair them.
        </p>
        <h2>Environment of the Conservation Room</h2>
        <p>The National Taiwan Museum belongs to the Ministry of Education. In the past, there were offices on the first
            floor, the Ministry of Education on one side, and the museum on the other. Later, because there wasn’t
            enough space, all the offices were changed to warehouses.
        </p>
        <p>Another problem is, the environment here is not ideal for storing things, as you can see when you step in
            this building, too many officials and civil officers walking around. The perfect warehouse condition is one
            like that in the Palace Museum. It was originally planned to be a workspace, with regulated entries and
            exits.
        </p>
        <p>Despite all the disadvantages, our location is actually very convenient. The land here is very expensive and
            therefore, we try to save as much space as possible, and try to maximize the use of storage areas.
        </p>
        <p>Originally, there was no such conservation room. It was originally a very small room, which only allowed us
            to do some simple cleaning work.
        </p>
        <p>Later, we secured funding and opportunities, purchased the equipment, and rearranged our working space to
            what you see now.
        </p>
        <p>In this space, we will do some processing and packaging of the artifacts. Because the collections returned
            from the outside are prone to risk of insects or molds, we have to observe all artifacts here for a week
            before storing it in the warehouse to avoid infection in the warehouse area.
        </p>
        <p>For example, when a person wants to clean a painting, he will do it in this room. We will not directly do
            these tasks in the warehouse. The equipment needed for restoring are all here.
        </p>
        <p>Now, let me introduce our environment..
        </p>
        <p>The entrance is our administration, general affairs or sign-in area, where members’ control, keys,
            telephones, and other objects are placed.
        </p>
        <p>Moving on, here is the material area. As you can see, there are shelves and rolls of packaging materials.
        </p>
        <p>Then there is our office area with a laptop. Sometimes there will be some data that needs to be checked,
            documents that need to be read, and that will be done here.
        </p>
        <p>This work table is flexible and can be raised and lowered. We found that with everyone’s height differences,
            it is necessary for the table to be adjustable to ensure a comfortable working area for our colleagues.
        </p>
        <p>Next, there is a magnetic board over there. It is grey because we see grey as a relatively neutral color. If
            we have larger works, we can use magnets to fix them on the wall to take photos.
        </p>
        <p>Photographing every step is very important to us. It is necessary to record the comparison before and after
            conservation, so we all use images to record its changes.
        </p>
        <p>Photographing is a basic requirement in our line of work. Because of the limited space, there is a sliding
            door, similar to a Japanese door. It can actually be used as a drying board and a framing table. And it can
            be folded when it is not in use to save space.
        </p>
        <p>Then there are safety issues. Because we are in the basement, there will be an emergency exit. If there is a
            fire, you can climb up the fire escape. Because you are visitors, and we still need to be cautious of theft
            and other related issues, please excuse me for not telling you where the exit leads to. Only our own
            colleagues know so they can lead the way in case of an emergency.
        </p>
        <p>And here is our wet area, which is basically a laboratory. The equipment is similar to those you see often in
            science class. The water we use all come from water purifiers, and is pure H2O.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the experimental bench. We have a microscope, or an electronic scale in case we want to create a
            solution that can be useful to the conservation. This room is full of tools that you will find in a regular
            laboratory. Additionally, we also use dry medical powder or other materials to conserve artifacts. In the
            laboratory, we also have a wet zone, which we use to create solutions. At the very back, you can see a white
            cabinet. It is called the “work bridge.” The “work bridge” will be used when we work on large conservation
            projects. For example, the size of the National Flag of the 1895 Republic of Formosa as an is more than 300
            cm, about 2 to 3 times the size of the work desk. When you spread the flag on the desk, it is not difficult
            to repair along the edges, but when we wanted to repair the inner areas, we encountered some problems. When
            we want to repair the inner areas, we require some support. As a result, the work bridge we specifically
            designed for the desk was just a tiny bit higher than the desk. When we want to repair a specific area or do
            some tests on a specific location, we can climb onto the bridge. At times, we also use the bridge to store
            some tools or instruments.
        </p>
        <p>There is a sink located under the desk. We use the sink to clean fabric or paper, so it is not a regular
            sink. It is specifically made for our conservation project, including its size, ability to spin, and ability
            to tilt. Therefore we can drain the water more easily. It can also act as a translucent plate. Some projects
            require us to use translucent techniques to check if the artifacts are damaged or repaired, or its paper
            layering.
        </p>
        <p>The above is about what you would see in a regular conservation room. We just obtained this new special
            instrument, called an XRF (X-ray fluorescence). We mostly use this instrument to analyze material. Through
            the XRF, we can analyze the chemicals that make up this artifact and what potential material it is made up
            of. This is a more scientific way of analyzing. There are many types of XRF. In the early days, an XRF is
            typically a desktop instrument and is harder to use, because you need to move the artifact sample into the
            machine. This specific type of XRF we bought includes a tripod and has XYZ axes. It can create a
            three-dimensional image of a specific area, and through computation, can immediately create a compound
            image, simultaneously creating a graph showing material distribution. As a result, we look forward that this
            XRF can help us do more complex analysis, enhancing our ability to conserve each artifact.
