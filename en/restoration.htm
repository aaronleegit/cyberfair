      <p><span>Restoration</p></span>
      <div class="m-line"></div>
    </h1>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Painting and calligraphy restoration are a very ancient industry. </span>
        <span>Similar occupations have existed ever since the invention of paper in the Eastern Han Dynasty, so the
          restoration process has a history of 1,700 years.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <h3>1. Temperature and Humidity Requirements for Different Artifacts</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Materials used to construct the artifacts are generally divided into two groups: organic and
          non-organic.</span>
        <span>Usually, 90% of the artifacts are made with organic materials.</span>
        <span>All organic materials are mostly hydrocarbons, and the rest are inorganic materials.</span>
        <span>Inorganic materials, such as bronze, jade, ceramic, or metals, have different preservation conditions as
          organic materials.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Artifacts get divided into different categories based on their types, for example, the Chinese painting
          and calligraphy category, which includes papers and silks.</span>
        <span>These artifacts would require a humidity of around 55%. </span>
        <span>The required temperature is also fixed at around 20°C. </span>
        <span>The restoration area in the National Palace Museum is chilly, and has been fixed at a temperature of 22°C
          in recent years, with a humidity of 58% percent. </span>
        <span>Artifacts like calligraphies, artwork, and lacquerware are best kept in this kind of environment. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>In addition, artifacts made of metals, like bronze tools, requires a lower humidity level. </span>
        <span>This is because artifacts constructed with metals are highly sensitive to water, requiring a humidity
          level of at most 45%. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Moreover, porcelain, pottery, and jade artifacts are basically less sensitive to humidity and
          temperature.</span>
        <span> So a restorer wouldn’t need to worry too much about the humidity and temperature, because the artifact
          isn’t sensitive to those conditions. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <h3>2. How to Decide Which Artifacts Need to be Restored</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Besides the ones which are going to be exhibited, there are two kinds of artwork that need to be repaired
          most often, one is calligraphy and painting, the other is books and documents.</span>

      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>These paper artworks were collected by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, as for the paintings and
          calligraphy may have been painted in Tang, song, yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties. </span>
        <span>These paper artworks are already over two hundred years old.</span>
        <span>All cultural relics have their own life span, in general, they can only last two to three hundred years
          when they are carefully conserved.</span>
        <span>Even if they are stored in the cabinet, they will still be affected by humidity, insects, or some files
          may be stacked in piles which result in deformation. </span>
        <span>Therefore, those paper artworks need to be repair frequently than other kinds of artifacts.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <h3>3. General Restoration Process</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        <img class="l-img w-5" src="../assets/img/restoration/S__37396509.jpg" />
        <span>From ancient times to the present, the entire restoration work has no fixed methods or fixed
          materials.</span>
        <span>In ancient times, the materials or methods used did not change as quickly as they are now.</span>
        <span>Nowadays, there are increasingly more materials that can be used to fix an art piece.</span>
        <span>However, when deciding whether to use a certain material, some rigorous experiments must be
          conducted.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Damaged cultural relics are like ill patients.</span>
        <span>A good doctor shouldn’t treat every patient in the same way, instead, he or she supposed to consider
          different physical conditions and make adjustments accordingly. </span>
        <span>Same rule applies to cultural relic restoration.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>However, there is still a standard procedure. </span>
        <span>Normally repairing a painting requires at least twenty to thirty basic steps. </span>
        <span>Sometimes a restorer will repeat the same step several times in order to get the best result, and the
          other times a few steps will be skipped due to the condition.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>The material used in the painting is also a factor. </span>
        <span>If the materials used for each painting are different, that will lead to different repairing
          process.</span>
        <span>For example, techniques used inn silk painting and paper painting are different. Sometimes size also
          affects.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>The following table shows the general restoring process.</span>

    <h3>4. Ways to Deal with Incidents</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Incidents do happen some times, and how to deal with those various from case to case. In general, the ways
          to deal with lent out and borrowed art pieces are different.</span>
        <span>Two cases and the solutions are shown in the following paragraphs.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Once, the British Museum sent some artifacts over to the National Palace Museum for exhibition. </span>
        <span>When restorers unboxed the artifact, they found it damaged.</span>
        <span>In scenarios like this, both sides need to discuss and come up with the best possible solution to restore
          the artifact.</span>
        <span>Because the artifact belonged to the British Museum, it involves many problems, such as insurance and
          responsibility. </span>
        <span>If the other side entrusts the National Palace Museum to restore it, we must do it perfectly.</span>
        <span>If the other side does not agree with the National Palace Museum to assist in restoration, then this
          artifact will not be displayed.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Another incident happened when artifacts from the National Palace Museum were sent to the Art Gallery of
          New South Wales.</span>
        <span> Even if the artifacts were inspected before going abroad, damages still occurred during the
          transportation.</span>
        <span>If it’s a minor problem, NPM can choose to have it repaired locally and displayed after restoration is
          completed. </span>

      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>When facing emergencies, there are specific procedures, but improvisation and an understanding of
          artifacts are necessary. </span>
        <span>All of these need to rely on accumulated experiences in order to respond to the situation
          immediately.</span>

      </span>
    </p>

    <img src="../assets/img/restoration/flow-en-2.png" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" alt="">
    <h3>5. Ways to Inspect Minor Damages</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        <img class="r-img w-5" src="../assets/img/restoration/168.jpg_1140x855.jpg" />
        <span>The most basic ability of restorers is the knowledge of artifacts. </span>
        <span>A restorer should have the ability to observe the serious changes of an artifact, such as dirt, water
          stains, creases, cracks, or breaks through the naked eye at first glance. </span>
        <span>However, the restorer often requires the assistance of some tools or instruments because our visual
          sensitivity sometimes is not good enough to spot small damages. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>First, the changes in lighting helps. Restorers turn off the front of the lights and use phones to light
          up from the side, which is called side light.</span>
        <span>Through side light, restorers can see the artifacts with a three-dimensional effect, which in turn allows
          us to see more details of the artifacts. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Another way is to use the "transparent" method, shining the light from the bottom and observing it from
          the top.</span>
        <span>By observing the artifacts from different points of view, we can sometimes spot micro damages. </span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>The above inspection is through visible lights.</span>
        <span>Sometimes, restorers use invisible lights such as ultraviolet or infrared lights. </span>
        <span>Through those special lights, one can inspect the damage that is invisible through the naked eyes.</span>
        <span>However, most of the time, one can determine what that needs to be repaired through the use of visible
          light.</span>
      </span>
    </p>
    <h3>6. Conservation and Restoration</h3>
    <p>
      <span>
        <span>Since a lot of people get confused about conservation and restoration, below are the similarities and
          differences between them.</span>
